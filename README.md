# IntegerArrayManipulation


This is a simple INTEGER array manipulation program.

Features:

1.Insert Elements into an array
2.Delete Elements from an array
3.Sort the array in ascending or descending order
4.Search for an Element in the array
5.Reverse the order of the array
6.View the array

Instructions :

Run this code in an IDE which takes input at run time

Clearing the screen:
   1. Use clrscr() - For TurboC Compiler (also include header conio.h)
   2. Use system("cls") - For gcc 4.9.2 and above
   3. Use system("clear") - For gcc/g++ compiler in Linux

In this program "position" does not mean index of an array

i.e,

Array = 1 2 3 4 5
   here the "position" of 3 is 3 and not 2 which is the index.

also "size" means the number of elements present in the array
and "elements" here mean integers.
